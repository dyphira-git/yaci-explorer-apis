-- Migration 043: Fix active validator count to exclude jailed validators
--
-- The validator_stats and chain_stats views incorrectly count jailed validators
-- as "active" because they only check status = 'BOND_STATUS_BONDED' without
-- excluding jailed = TRUE. This causes counts like "110 active validators"
-- when the chain max is 100 (because 10 are jailed).
